Movie App Development Project

Objective
Develop a fully functional movie app using Next.js and React within 4 weeks. The app should display a list of movies with details like title, epilogue, category, type, actors, and kind of movie. Additionally, the app should allow users to search for movies, filter by category or actor, and include functionalities for liking movies and adding them to a watch later list.

Use Next.js for the front-end framework.
Create an array of objects for movie data with the following properties:
title: The title of the movie.
epilogue: A brief summary of the movie.
Date released: date the movie was released.
category: The genre of the movie (e.g., Action,Drama, Comedy).
type: The type of movie (e.g., Feature Film, Documentary, Short Film).
actors: A list of main actors.
triller: a link to the movie or triller on youtube.
rating: movie rating on a scale 0-10, 10-100, 1-5.
keywords: keywords associated with a particular film.
kind: The classification (e.g., PG, R, G).
Implement search functionality for movies, categories, and actors.
Implement filters for categories and actors.
